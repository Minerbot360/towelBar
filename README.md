# towelBar
A towel bar meant to hook onto something with holes for 1/2 inch magenets

I made this as a little practical project in OnShape. The bar is meant to be mounted over a sink for a small washcloth/towel. I added holes for 1/2 inch magenets. They help the bar stay in place when pulling the towel on and off.
